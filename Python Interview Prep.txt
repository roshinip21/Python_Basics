For preparing the live Python coding round, letâ€™s focus on a few key areas in data science that commonly appear in such technical interviews. Here are the areas to practice, along with recommended resources:

### 1. **Data Manipulation with Pandas**
   - **Topics:** Data cleaning, transformations, grouping, merging, handling missing values, and basic data analysis with Pandas.
   - **Resources:**
     - [Pandas Official Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html): The "10 Minutes to Pandas" is a quick intro.
     - [Kaggle Python and Pandas Micro-Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas): Kaggle provides an interactive learning environment with practice exercises.

### 2. **Data Visualization**
   - **Topics:** Creating plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn to quickly explore and visualize data.
   - **Resources:**
     - [Seaborn Official Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Great for examples and starting with visualizations.
     - [Matplotlib and Seaborn Tutorial on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-seaborn): Walks you through the basics of visualization in Python.

### 3. **Basic Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**
   - **Topics:** Building simple models, performing train-test splits, cross-validation, and evaluating models (accuracy, RMSE, classification metrics).
   - **Resources:**
     - [Scikit-Learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html): Start with simple classification and regression models.
     - [Machine Learning with Python on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning): Focused on building and validating simple models.

### 4. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - **Topics:** Handling missing data, outliers, and feature scaling (e.g., MinMaxScaler in scikit-learn).
   - **Resources:** 
     - [Python Data Cleaning Tutorial on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-cleaning-in-python): Covers real-world data cleaning scenarios.
     - [Python Data Wrangling on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning): Practical exercises on data wrangling.

### 5. **Python Core Concepts**
   - **Topics:** List comprehensions, lambda functions, basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), and writing reusable functions.
   - **Resources:**
     - [LeetCode Python Basics](https://leetcode.com/tag/python/): Practice problems categorized by difficulty.
     - [HackerRank Python Track](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-python): Step-by-step, starting with beginner-level Python.

### 6. **SQL (If Needed)**
   - **Topics:** Joins, aggregations, filtering, and subqueries.
   - **Resources:**
     - [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/): A great resource to practice SQL queries in an interactive way.
     - [Mode Analytics SQL Tutorial](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/): Practical SQL exercises with data science applications.

### Practice Workflows
1. **Download Datasets** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and build end-to-end workflows involving data loading, cleaning, transformation, model building, and evaluation.
2. **Create a GitHub Repository** where you can keep track of your progress and document solutions.
