## Script Breakdown of Functions

1. scrape_jobs(url, keywords, pages=1) : Scrapes job postings from the given URL and filters them based on the provided keywords.
2. scrape_profile(driver, profile_url) : Extracts profile information including the LinkedIn profile URL.
3. send_email(sender_email, sender_password, recipient_emails, subject, body, jobs_df, profile_df) : Sends an email with the job postings and profile data attached as an Excel file.
4. main() : Coordinates the scraping process and sends the email with the collected data.


## Troubleshooting
- NoSuchElementException: This error occurs if the element cannot be found on the page. Ensure that the LinkedIn profile is fully loaded and that the element selectors are correct.
- TimeoutException: May occur if the page takes too long to load. Consider increasing the wait times if you experience this issue frequently.
